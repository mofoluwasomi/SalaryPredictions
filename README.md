# Salary Prediction Project 

## Project overview 
This project aims to predict STEM salaries using various classifiers, with a focus on identifying the optimal classifier for accurate predictions. The analysis is performed on a dataset containing 62,642 STEM salary records, sourced from Kaggle.

### Key Features of the Dataset
- The dataset encompasses a range of critical information, including company details, job titles, experience levels, and more.
- A total of 29 columns are included, providing a comprehensive view of the factors influencing STEM salaries.

### Classifiers Used

In this project, we employ multiple classifiers to analyze the data, including:

- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes (NB)
- Random Forest Classifier
- K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### Implementation Details

**Libraries Used:** The project utilizes Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
**Data Preprocessing:** Steps include encoding categorical data and managing date formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis: The notebook includes visualizations and analyses to understand the data's characteristics.
